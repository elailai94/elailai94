My name is Elisha. I'm a Software Developer on the Digital Core team at [BMO Bank of Montreal](https://www.bmo.com/main/about-bmo/) building serverless applications to help customers make real financial progress. I studied Computer Science at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/about/), where I was a member of [WASL](https://wasl.uwaterloo.ca/) in the [SYN](https://syn.uwaterloo.ca/) group conducting performance tests on distributed publish-subscribe messaging systems under the supervision of Professor [Samer Al-Kiswany](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~alkiswan/). My past work includes:

- Building mobile apps to track anxiety at [Airo Health](https://www.linkedin.com/company/airo-health/about/);
- Revamping web apps to drive donations at [Mon Sheong Foundation](https://www.monsheong.org/about-us/);
- Developing dynamic videos for financial institutions and insurance companies at [Rich Media](https://www.richmedia.com/).
